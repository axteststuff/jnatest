This test uses JNA (Java Native API).. it is the same results with JNI

To make two shared libs and test:
	make two
	make test  # will fail with "Exceptionjava.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: libmyalloc.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)/linux-x86-64 make test          # will succees.. LD_LIBRARY_PATH path helps to find the 2nd shared lib

To make one shared lib and test:
	make one
	make test  # will succeed..

java.library.path can be set via -Djava.library.path or setProperties(), which is how it is done in code App.java.
